## Installation
 - for use with [MH2p SD ModKit](https://github.com/LawPaul/MH2p_SD_ModKit)
## How it works
 - `fc.jar` is copied to MH2p at `/mnt/app/eso/hmi/lsd/jars`
 - jars in that directory are loaded onto the classpath before `lsd.jar` which runs the UI
 - classes in `fc.jar` are prioritized over those in `lsd.jar` and can modify functionality
